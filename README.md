Netflix Clone Repository

Welcome to my Netflix clone project repository! This project is a recreation of the popular streaming service, Netflix, using only HTML and CSS. It provides a responsive user interface where users can explore a variety of movies and TV shows, watch trailers, and sign in to their accounts.

Key Features:

A Responsive web design on my take of the home page of https://www.netflix.com/in/ using my knowledge of HTML and CSS

HTML5 for structuring the web pages
CSS3 for styling and layout
GitHub for version control and collaboration
